## Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Monocular 3D Object Detection via Self-Training

Sorry that I have left SenseTime, and I cannot release the codes without the official certification right now. I may consider extending this work independently and will release an enhanced version in the future.

If your research needs to base our implementation, feel free to contact me personally. I'd like to send a link to our source codes, but I may be slow to react since I'm busy looking for a phd position.
